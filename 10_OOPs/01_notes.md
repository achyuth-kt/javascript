# Does Javascript has classes

-Yes, JavaScript has classes. Classes were introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) as a syntactical sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance. They provide a more familiar and convenient syntax for creating objects and dealing with inheritance.
-it is proto-type based language

## OOP
### objects
-collection of properties and methods
-Ex : toLowercase(),length(),slice()...

## why use oops

## parts of object
object literals(means literally it is an object)

-Constructor function
-protoType
-classes
-instances(new,this and so on)

## 4 pillars of oops
-abstraction
-encapsulation
-inheritance
-polymorphism
